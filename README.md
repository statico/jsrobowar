JSRoboWar
=========

To see it in action, go to [http://statico.github.io/jsrobowar/](http://statico.github.io/jsrobowar/).

I wrote JSRoboWar as a programming exercise. I'm not devoting a lot of time to developing it, but feel free to fork it and send me patches.

Code layout:

* `js/jsrobowar.js` -- The core JSRoboWar engine.
* `js/gui.js` -- All code used to set up `index.html`.
* `js/third-party/base.js` -- A JavaScript object system by John Resig.
* `js/third-party/raphael-*.js` -- The [RaphaÃ«l JavaScript library](http://raphaeljs.com/).
* `js/third-party/underscore-*.js` -- The [Underscore.js functional helper library](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/).
* `index.html` -- The main UI featuring the Arena and robot code editor.
* `robots/` -- A selection of robots from [the original RoboWar application](http://robowar.sf.net/) and [Paul Hansen's RoboWar Tutorial](http://www.stanford.edu/~pch/robowar/tutorial/Tutorial.html).
* `sounds/` -- Sounds from [the original RoboWar application](http://robowar.sf.net/).
* `LICENSE` -- The license for this source code.

I've tried hard to give credit where it's due. Let me know if I've missed something!
